            You can view the general status about your farm in this page, which includes: (a) the number of active infestations, (b) when the last inspection was performed, and (c) when pesticides were last applied.
            This page also provides various access points to the app's functionality, such as:
        </p>
        <ol class="m-0">
            <li><strong>Detection and Classification</strong> - Find possible pest infestations and categorize pests on banana crops using AI.</li>
            <li><strong>Statistics and Analysis</strong> - View insights on the banana crops' growth and status, including pest infestation history.</li>
            <li><strong>Overall Plot Health</strong> - Learn more about the banana cropsâ€™ health using collected data.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="mb-0">Detection and Classification</h3>
        <p class="m-0">
            You can detect pest infestations in your farm plots and conduct preventive measures if necessary in this page.
            At the header, there are two (2) options:
        </p>
        <ol class="m-0">
            <li><strong>Detect From Image</strong> - You can manually identify and check for pests in a specific area by uploading an image from your phone, which can either be a newly-captured picture or from your Gallery.</li>
            <li><strong>View Previous Detections</strong> - This redirects you to the Previos Detections section under the Statistics and Analysis page, allowing you to review your farm's pest infestation history based on the AI's data.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-0">
            At the main section, each plot of your farm is spread across a grid representing the different areas of your farm.
        </p>
        <p class="m-0">
            Each item or plot in the grid provides you with quick information about pest infestations. This can be viewed individually to reveal more detail about a specific plot. This includes the following:
        </p>
        <ol type="a" class="m-0">
            <li>The ability to apply pesticides;</li>
            <li>Recent images captured by the drone's camera;</li>
            <li>Amount of pests detected;</li>
            <li>Pesticide failure rate for that plot, and;</li>
            <li>An analysis report generated by the app about pest infestations.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-0">
            At the bottom or last section, the common types of banana pests are shown alongside short and concise descriptions about them..
        </p>
        <p class="m-0">
            A link pointing to a web page that explains more about a specific pest is also provided in each item for your convenience.  
        </p>
        <h3 class="mb-0">Statistics and Analysis</h3>
        <p class="m-0">
            You can browse through the AI's previous detections of pest infestations in your farm's banana crops in this page.
        </p>
        <p class="m-0">
            Each plot with a previously-detected infestation is shown with the date and time of detection and whether pesticides were applied or not to that plot. Clicking on these items will also reveal more detailed information about that plot, similar to those shown in the Detection and Analysis page.
        </p>
        <p class="m-0">
            In the Statistics section on the right, line graphs that detail information about all the plots in the farm are shown. This includes:
        </p>
        <ol type="a" class="m-0">
            <li>The severity of pest infestations over time;</li>
            <li>Amount of pests detected for all plots, and;</li>
            <li>Pesticide failure rate for all plots.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="mb-0">Overall Plot Health</h3>
        <p class="m-0">
            You can look at the estimated health of all plots, spread across a grid, in this page.
        </p>
        <p class="m-0">
            This shows you images captured by drones for all plots alongside relevant status information for each plot, such as how often pest infestations happen in that specific plot, without having to click through every plot individually.
